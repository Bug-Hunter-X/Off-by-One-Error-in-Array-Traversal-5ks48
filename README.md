This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating over arrays.  The `BuggyArray.java` file contains the erroneous code, resulting in an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The solution, provided in `FixedArray.java`, corrects the loop condition to prevent the out-of-bounds access.  This example highlights the importance of carefully considering loop termination conditions when working with arrays.
